I"˜<p>Imagine a fluid flowing through space. This could be the air circulating in your room, water flowing through a pipe, oil spilling in the ocean, etc. We want to be able to model these types of fluid motion, but how? In contrast to solid bodies, fluids can change their shape and most likely have different physical properties throughout space <em>and</em> time (temperature, pressure, velocity, etc.).</p>
