I"<p>This is a simple step-by-step guide to setting up Armadillo C++ on your Mac. I will be starting from the <b> very beginning </b> assuming you were handed a brand new laptop with nothing installed on it. This guide will go through all the nitty-gritty details. Letâ€™s begin!</p>

<h1 id="download--install-xcode">Download &amp; Install Xcode</h1>

<ul>
<li>Open up your App Store and search for "xcode"</li>
<li>Click on "GET"/"INSTALL" to start your download</li>

<h2 id="downloading-xcode-for-older-macs">Downloading Xcode for older Macs</h2>
<p>If you have an older Mac you can still download the version of Xcode that is compatible with it at <a href="https://xcodereleases.com"> https://xcodereleases.com </a>.</p>

<p>For instance, the machine Iâ€™m downloading this software on is a 2013 Macbook Pro running on MacOS Catalina 10.15. This Mac is not compatible with the latest version of Xcode thatâ€™s offered in the App Store, so I had to download the 12.4 Release version instead.</p>

<h3 style="color:red;">WARNING:</h3>
<p>If you see your Xcode program installed somewhere <em>besides</em> your â€œApplicationsâ€ directory, you will have to drag and drop it in â€œApplicationsâ€ before moving forward.</p>
