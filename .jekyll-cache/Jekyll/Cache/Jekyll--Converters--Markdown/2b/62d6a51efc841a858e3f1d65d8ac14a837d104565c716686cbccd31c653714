<p>Also known as the ‘Substantial Derivative”.
Imagine a fluid flowing through space. This could be the air circulation in your room, water flowing through a pipe, oil spill in the ocean, etc. We want to be able to model these types of fluid motion. At first this may be tricky to think of when comparing how we solve for properties of solid things. If you throw a rock (undergoing translational motion), it will stay the same size and shape,</p>
