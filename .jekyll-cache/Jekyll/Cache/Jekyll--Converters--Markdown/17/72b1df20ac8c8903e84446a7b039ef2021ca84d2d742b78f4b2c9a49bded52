I"›<p>Imagine a fluid flowing through space. This could be the air circulating in your room, water flowing through a pipe, oil spilling in the ocean, etc. We want to be able to model these types of fluid motion, but how? In contrast to solid bodies, fluids can change their shape and most likely have different physical properties throughout space <em>and</em> time (temperature, pressure, velocity, etc.).</p>

<p>Compared to solid bodies undergoing translational motion, At first this may be tricky to think of when comparing how we solve for properties of solid things; if you throw a rock (undergoing translational motion), it will stay the same size and shape, and the velocity at each point of that rock is the same.</p>
